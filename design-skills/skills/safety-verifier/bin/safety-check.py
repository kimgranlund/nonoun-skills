"""safety-check.py — the safety-verifier destructive-action linter. Self-contained (stdlib only).

A "destructive-action card" is the small declarative artifact safety-verifier emits for each
high-consequence action *before* a UI affordance is attached to it (and re-derives when auditing
one that exists). This linter routes the MECHANIZABLE invariants of the skill to code — the
judgment-heavy reviews (is the named consequence honest? is the recovery path real? is the
audit event actually surfaced?) stay in SKILL.md. It checks one or more cards (JSON) and reports
FAILs (gate violations) and WARNs (policy advisories / friction smells).

This is a LOSSY PRE-FILTER, not an oracle: a card clearing the gate is necessary, not sufficient —
it proves the *declared* friction matches the declared (blast × reversibility) coordinate, NOT that
the action is safe. Confirm the dangerous case (high-blast / irreversible) adversarially.
