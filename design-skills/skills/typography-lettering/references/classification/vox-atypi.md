# Vox-ATypI Classification

The Vox-ATypI system is the classification most type specimens, foundry catalogs, type-design curricula, and ISO-style institutional references default to when they need a shared vocabulary for "what kind of typeface is this." It was created by **Maximilien Vox** in 1954, adopted almost verbatim by the **Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI)** in 1962, codified in Britain as **BS 2961:1967 — Typeface Nomenclature and Classification**, and lightly amended by ATypI in 2010. Its strengths and seams are both a product of its era: it was authored before digital type, before global (non-Latin) typography became a first-class concern in Western foundries, and before the sans-serif tradition had produced the density of distinctions we now take for granted.

This file is the medium reference for Vox-ATypI: what the categories are, where each came from, what goes in each bucket, where the system creaks, and what disagreements to expect in practice.

## History

### Vox, 1954

**Maximilien Vox** (1894–1974) was a French typographer, writer, and publisher who spent the 1930s–1950s critiquing the idiosyncratic, foundry-by-foundry naming of typefaces — each foundry called its own Garamond a "Garamond" and its own Clarendon a "Clarendon," with no agreement on what either word covered. Vox's 1954 essay *Pour une nouvelle classification des caractères* (published by the École Estienne, Paris) proposed a **nine-category grouping** organized chronologically by the dominant typographic sensibility of successive eras — from humanist manuscript roots through industrial-era slab serifs and sans — with a tenth bucket for broken-script (fraktur / blackletter) which stands outside the main chronological arc.

Vox's contribution was not the invention of the categories themselves — Thibaudeau (1921), Updike (1922), Francis Meynell (1923), and the Bauer Foundry had all published earlier taxonomies — but the **insistence on a culturally descriptive vocabulary** (Humanes, Garaldes, Réales, Didones, Mécanes, Linéales, Incises, Scriptes, Manuaires, Fractures) rather than serif-silhouette mechanics (Thibaudeau's antiques, égyptiennes, elzévirs, didots). The neologisms are made up of composites: *Garalde* = Garamond + Aldus; *Didone* = Didot + Bodoni; *Mécane* = mechanical / machine-age.

### ATypI adoption, 1962

At its **Stockholm congress in 1962**, ATypI adopted Vox's classification as the organization's official reference, giving the system the ATypI imprimatur and effectively making it the international-standard vocabulary. ATypI did not materially change the ten categories; it formalized them and propagated them through the international type community via specimens, foundry catalogs, and the eventual British Standard.

### BS 2961:1967

The **British Standards Institution** published **BS 2961:1967 — Typeface Nomenclature and Classification** in 1967. It is based substantially on Vox-ATypI but uses English names (Humanist, Garalde, Transitional, Didone, Slab-serif, Lineal, Glyphic, Script, Graphic, Black-letter) and adds minor subclassifications — most importantly, the four-way subdivision of **Lineal** into *Grotesque*, *Neo-Grotesque*, *Geometric*, and *Humanist* sans. This subdivision is the single most durable contribution of the BS version; the Lineal-quadrant vocabulary is now used almost universally, including by foundries that never cite BS 2961 as the source.

BS 2961 was **withdrawn** by BSI in the 2010s (the British Standard catalog no longer lists it as current). The vocabulary it defined remains in general use.

### ATypI 2010 revision

ATypI revisited the classification in **2010** under the broader "Classification Vox-ATypI" banner. The revision was light — the ten categories were retained — but added:

- An **eleventh bucket, *Étrangères* (Foreign / Non-Latin)**, as an explicit acknowledgment that Latin-rooted categories do not meaningfully classify Arabic, Devanagari, CJK, Hebrew, Thai, or other scripts. This is widely understood as a placeholder rather than a serious classification of non-Latin typography — which has its own script-specific conventions (see `../scripts/`) that the Vox framework was never designed to describe.
- **Explicit acknowledgment of overlap** — a typeface can legitimately sit in two categories (a humanist sans is both Linéale Humaniste and close to Incise; Optima, famously, has been classified as both Linéale Humaniste and Incise depending on whose system you use).
- **Recognition that digital-era faces** resist clean classification — the variable-font, screen-first, superfamily era (roughly 2000s onward) has produced faces that embody multiple traditions at once (Fraunces, Recursive, Roboto Flex).

The 2010 revision did **not** solve the underlying scope problems. It is better described as a patch acknowledging limits than a re-architecture.

### Relationship to DIN 16518

**DIN 16518** (Deutsches Institut für Normung) is a parallel German industrial classification, first published in 1964 (post-Vox, post-ATypI adoption). It uses different category names (*Venezianische Renaissance-Antiqua*, *Französische Renaissance-Antiqua*, *Barock-Antiqua*, *Klassizistische Antiqua*, *Serifenbetonte Linear-Antiqua*, *Serifenlose Linear-Antiqua*, *Antiqua-Varianten*, *Schreibschriften*, *Handschriftliche Antiqua*, *Gebrochene Schriften*, *Fremde Schriften*) and partitions the space slightly differently — most notably keeping **Antiqua-Varianten** (Glyphic / flared) and **Handschriftliche Antiqua** (casual hand) as separate categories rather than Vox's *Incises* and *Manuaires*, and maintaining **Gebrochene Schriften** with five sub-categories of blackletter (Gotisch, Rundgotisch, Schwabacher, Fraktur, Fraktur-Varianten). DIN retains formal authority in German-speaking type education; Vox-ATypI is more common internationally. See `./din-16518.md`.

## The nine (then ten, then eleven) categories

The original Vox proposal is usually given as **nine** categories; Fraktures / blackletter is counted as the tenth when presented in BS 2961 and most English sources; Étrangères is the eleventh added in 2010. The table below presents all eleven in the order they are conventionally taught, with their French, English (BS 2961), and German (for cross-reference) names.

| Vox (French) | BS 2961 (English) | DIN 16518 (German) | Era | Anchor examples |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Humanes** | Humanist | Venezianische Renaissance-Antiqua | 1460s–1500 | Centaur, Cloister, Adobe Jenson, Schneidler |
| **Garaldes** | Garalde | Französische Renaissance-Antiqua | 1500–1750 | Garamond, Bembo, Sabon, Minion, Granjon |
| **Réales** | Transitional | Barock-Antiqua | ~1700–1800 | Baskerville, Fournier, Bell, Caslon (late) |
| **Didones** | Didone | Klassizistische Antiqua | ~1780–1850 | Didot, Bodoni, Walbaum, Modern No. 20 |
| **Mécanes** | Slab-serif / Mechanistic | Serifenbetonte Linear-Antiqua | 1815– | Clarendon, Rockwell, Memphis, Courier, Archer |
| **Linéales** | Lineal / Sans-serif | Serifenlose Linear-Antiqua | 1816– | Akzidenz-Grotesk, Helvetica, Futura, Gill Sans |
| **Incises** | Glyphic | Antiqua-Varianten | — | Albertus, Copperplate Gothic, Trajan, Perpetua |
| **Scriptes** | Script | Schreibschriften | — | Zapfino, Bickham Script, Snell Roundhand |
| **Manuaires** | Graphic | Handschriftliche Antiqua | — | Klang, Papyrus, Lithos |
| **Fractures** | Black-letter | Gebrochene Schriften | 1450s– | Textura, Rotunda, Schwabacher, Fraktur |
| **Étrangères** (2010) | Non-Latin | Fremde Schriften | — | (everything not Latin-script) |

### Humanes (Humanist)

The earliest roman types, cut in the 1460s–1490s by printers working to imitate the **humanist minuscule** — a late-medieval Italian scribal hand that revived Carolingian minuscule as a reaction against Gothic textura. The first definitively humanist roman is **Nicolas Jenson's 1470 Venetian roman**, followed by the types of Aldus Manutius (pre-Griffo), Johannes de Spira, and others.

Humanes characteristics:

- Low stroke contrast (pen-like — the variation between thick and thin strokes is small).
- **Slanted axis** (the axis of the `o` and `O` tilts to the left, following the pen angle of a humanist scribe).
- Small x-height; tall ascenders.
- Bracketed, slanted serifs on the lowercase; flat serifs on caps.
- A distinctive slanted crossbar on the lowercase `e` (the "humanist e") — this is the single most reliable single-glyph marker of the Humanes family.

Anchor digital revivals: Adobe Jenson (Robert Slimbach, 1996), Centaur (Bruce Rogers, 1914), Cloister Old Style (M. F. Benton, 1897), Schneidler Old Style (F. H. E. Schneidler, 1936), LTC Jenson, Centaur MT.

Traps:

- Many so-called "old-style" faces are Garaldes, not Humanes — Garamond is Garalde, not Humanist. The humanist sleeve is small: only the earliest Venetian revivals qualify.
- Adobe's own classification marks some faces as "humanist" that Vox would classify as Garalde.

### Garaldes (Garalde / Old-Style)

The dominant roman tradition of the **16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries** — the typefaces of **Francesco Griffo** (working for Aldus Manutius in Venice, from ~1495), **Claude Garamond** (Paris, 1530s–1560s), **Robert Granjon**, **Christoffel van Dijck**, and **Jean Jannon**. The name is a portmanteau: **Gar**amond + **Ald**us.

Characteristics vs Humanes:

- Higher stroke contrast (still moderate, but more pronounced thick-thin variation).
- Still-slanted axis, but less tilted than Humanes.
- More refined, more regular, better-fitted.
- Bracketed serifs; sometimes sharper than Humanes.
- The crossbar of `e` is horizontal, not slanted (Humanes had a slanted crossbar).

Anchor faces: Garamond (Claude Garamond, various digital revivals — Adobe Garamond by Slimbach 1989, Garamond Premier 2005, ITC Garamond is an anomaly), Bembo (Aldus/Griffo 1495, digital Monotype Bembo 1929), Sabon (Jan Tschichold 1967), Minion (Slimbach 1990), Granjon, Galliard, Centaur is Humanist not Garalde despite sometimes being shelved with them.

Traps:

- **ITC Garamond** (Tony Stan, 1977) is visually *not* a Garalde despite the name — it has a much higher x-height, tighter fit, and more modern fit than historical Garamond; it reads closer to a transitional or even a contemporary serif. Consider it nominally Garalde but practically its own category.
- **Sabon** is explicitly a Garamond-based Garalde (Tschichold's brief was a Garamond for Linotype machines that would cast identically on Linotype, Monotype, and foundry type).

### Réales (Transitional)

The **mid-18th century bridge** between Garalde and Didone. Named *Réales* by Vox after the work of **Pierre Simon Fournier** (Paris, 1730s–1760s) and **John Baskerville** (Birmingham, 1750s), with ancestry in the Romain du Roi (a rationalized roman commissioned by Louis XIV, 1692, cut by Philippe Grandjean beginning 1702).

Characteristics:

- **Increased stroke contrast** compared to Garalde — the thicks are heavier, the thins are finer.
- **Vertical axis** (the `o` is symmetric; no pen-tilt).
- **Finer, sharper serifs** — still bracketed but more crisp.
- Regularized proportions — the rationalist, Enlightenment sensibility visible in Baskerville's printing.

Anchor faces: Baskerville (Baskerville 1757, digital ITC New Baskerville, Berthold Baskerville Book), Fournier (Fournier 1742, Monotype Fournier), Bell (Richard Austin 1788), Bulmer (William Martin 1790s), Caslon (William Caslon I, 1720s — this is the contested case; see below).

Traps / the Caslon question:

- **William Caslon's** (1692–1766) types are sometimes classified as **Garalde** (on the basis of their English adaptation of Dutch / Flemish Garalde traditions) and sometimes as **Réale / Transitional** (on the basis of their date — 1720s — and their role bridging to later English work). Vox himself was inconsistent. Current practice: **early Caslon (pre-1740) = Garalde; later Caslon revivals (Caslon 540, Caslon 3, ITC Founder's Caslon) sit on the Garalde / Réale boundary and can be taught as either.** The digital "Adobe Caslon" (Carol Twombly, 1990) sits comfortably in Garalde.
- **Times New Roman** (Stanley Morison / Victor Lardent, 1932) is sometimes shelved as Réale, sometimes as a category of its own ("newspaper transitional"), sometimes as a 20th-c. Garalde. It was *designed as* a transitional-derivative for newspaper printing; practically, classify as Réale / Transitional.

### Didones (Modern / Didone)

Late-18th to mid-19th century. Named after **Firmin Didot** (Paris, 1784 onward) and **Giambattista Bodoni** (Parma, 1780s–1810s). The name *Didone* is a portmanteau: **Did**ot + **Bod**oni.

Characteristics — the most extreme typographic vocabulary Vox's system contains:

- **Extreme stroke contrast** — thin parts become hairlines, thick parts become broad vertical stems.
- **Fully vertical axis** (completely rationalized).
- **Hairline, unbracketed serifs** — flat, thin, often connected to the stem with a sharp right angle rather than a curved bracket.
- Rationalized, often mathematically regular construction.

Anchor faces: Didot (Didot 1784, digital HTF Didot 1992, Linotype Didot), Bodoni (Bodoni 1790s, digital ITC Bodoni 72 / Bodoni Poster, Berthold Bodoni, Bauer Bodoni — each revival has dramatically different metrics), Walbaum (Justus Erich Walbaum, 1800, digital Walbaum 2018 by Monotype), Modern No. 20, Scotch Roman (a related British tradition, sometimes classified separately).

Traps:

- Not every Didone revival is the same — **Bauer Bodoni** is the crispest, thinnest revival; **Bodoni Poster** is a fattened display cut; **ITC Bodoni 72** (Sumner Stone et al., 1994) has optical sizes that are dramatically different at 6pt, 12pt, 72pt — treat each as a different face.
- Modern sans-serifs are sometimes called "modern" in casual English — they are not Didone. The casual English "modern" (as in "modern sans") ≠ Vox *Didone*.

### Mécanes (Slab-serif / Egyptian)

**1815 onward** — a product of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of commercial display printing. First appeared in **Vincent Figgins**' specimen of 1815 (showing a "two-line English Antique" — a heavy slab-serif display face). Named *Égyptiennes* in French (no connection to Egypt — the name was fashionable in the 1810s post-Napoleon).

Characteristics:

- **Slab (square or rectangular) serifs** rather than bracketed or triangular.
- Minimal to moderate stroke contrast — often monoline.
- Design originally for posters, broadsides, display — later adapted to text.
- Two major sub-traditions: **unbracketed Egyptian** (Memphis, Rockwell — the slabs meet the stems at right angles) vs **bracketed Clarendon-style** (Clarendon, Farnham — the slabs are connected by a bracket curve, producing a less harsh junction).

Anchor faces: Clarendon (R. Besley & Co., 1845, digital Clarendon Text 2009, Farnham Display), Rockwell (Monotype 1934), Memphis (R. E. Weiss 1929), Courier (Howard Kettler 1955 — monospaced slab; originally for IBM typewriters), Archer (Hoefler&Frere-Jones 2001), Roboto Slab, Serifa (Adrian Frutiger 1967).

Traps:

- **Monospaced slabs** (Courier, Monaco, Andale Mono) are technically Mécanes *and* monospaced — Vox's framework doesn't cleanly account for monospace.
- **Clarendon** (bracketed slabs) is sometimes split out as its own category — in BS 2961 and some modern treatments, Clarendon is a subcategory of Slab-serif. The difference between unbracketed (Memphis, Rockwell) and bracketed (Clarendon, Farnham) is stylistically large enough that some practitioners treat them as separate.

### Linéales (Lineal / Sans-serif)

First sans-serif types date to **1816** (William Caslon IV's "Two Lines English Egyptian" — a caps-only monoline, technically the first printed sans) and **1819** (the Thorowgood sans — the first lowercase sans). The category explodes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with Berthold's **Akzidenz-Grotesk** (1898), and again in the mid-20th century with **Helvetica**, **Univers**, and **Futura**.

Vox's original 1954 proposal did not subdivide Linéales. **BS 2961:1967** introduced the four-way subdivision that is now standard:

#### Grotesque (19th-century sans)

The first sans-serif tradition — **Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk** (1898, drawn from late-19th-century German foundry sans), American Type Founders' **Franklin Gothic** (Morris Fuller Benton, 1902), **News Gothic** (Benton, 1908), **Trade Gothic** (Jackson Burke, 1948).

Characteristics:

- Irregular, quirky proportions (not yet standardized).
- Often a "g" with a two-story double-bowl construction.
- Visible stroke contrast (thicker where a pen would thicken).
- An organic, somewhat industrial, workmanlike voice.

Anchor faces: Akzidenz-Grotesk, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Trade Gothic, Monotype Grotesque.

#### Neo-Grotesque (mid-20th-century Swiss rationalization)

**Helvetica** (Max Miedinger / Eduard Hoffmann, Haas Type Foundry 1957, originally Neue Haas Grotesk), **Univers** (Adrian Frutiger, Deberny & Peignot 1957), **Arial** (Monotype 1982, a Helvetica-metric-compatible).

Characteristics vs Grotesque:

- Rationalized, regularized proportions — each letter drawn to harmonize with the others.
- Single-story `g` (in Helvetica, Univers) or regularized two-story (Akzidenz was irregular).
- Minimal stroke contrast (monoline ideal, though never truly monoline).
- Cool, neutral, International Typographic Style voice.

Anchor faces: Helvetica / Helvetica Neue / Helvetica Now, Univers (Univers 45 through 85, a matrix system), Neue Haas Grotesk, Arial, Folio, Aktiv Grotesk.

#### Geometric

**Futura** (Paul Renner, Bauer 1927) launched the geometric tradition — sans where the letters are constructed from geometric primitives (circles for `o`, triangles for `A`, straight lines for stems). Kabel (Rudolf Koch 1927), Erbar (Jakob Erbar 1922) preceded Futura but Futura dominated.

Characteristics:

- Circular `o`, `O`, `C`, `G`, `Q` — often geometrically exact.
- Triangular `A`, `V`, `W`.
- Minimal stroke contrast (truly monoline in ideal; optical correction always present).
- Long ascenders on `b`, `d`, `l` — classical rather than UI-tall proportions.
- Bauhaus / modernist aesthetic.

Anchor faces: Futura (all cuts), Avenir (Frutiger 1988 — geometric with humanist leanings), Avant Garde Gothic (Herb Lubalin / Tom Carnase 1970), Century Gothic, ITC Kabel, Gotham (Hoefler&Frere-Jones 2000 — an American geometric).

Traps:

- **Avenir** is sometimes shelved as Geometric, sometimes as Humanist-geometric hybrid. Frutiger himself described Avenir as a "humanist geometric" — it softens the pure-geometry construction of Futura with pen-sensibility adjustments (e.g., different widths for `O` vs `Q`).
- **Gotham** has proportions closer to American sign-painting geometric tradition than Bauhaus — a distinct substream.

#### Humanist sans

The most recent Linéale subdivision. **Gill Sans** (Eric Gill, Monotype 1928) anchors the English tradition. **Optima** (Hermann Zapf, 1958) — which is also claimed by *Incises*. **Frutiger** (Adrian Frutiger, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport signage 1976). **Myriad** (Robert Slimbach and Carol Twombly, Adobe 1992). **Meta** (Erik Spiekermann, 1991). **Segoe UI** (Steve Matteson, Microsoft 2004). **Lucida Sans** (Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes, 1985).

Characteristics vs Geometric/Neo-Grotesque:

- Proportions of Humanist/Garalde serif lowercase, drawn without serifs — a true-italic tradition is common.
- Some stroke contrast (the `e` has a thick-thin variation).
- Double-story `a` and `g` drawn with the humanist-Garalde pen sensibility.
- Warmer, more readable voice for long-form text than Neo-Grotesque.

Anchor faces: Gill Sans, Frutiger, Myriad, FF Meta, Segoe UI, Lucida Sans, Stone Sans, Source Sans 3 (Adobe, Paul D. Hunt, 2012), Open Sans (Steve Matteson 2010), Fira Sans (Erik Spiekermann / Carrois 2014).

Traps:

- **Optima** (Zapf, 1958) — arguably the most-disputed classification in all of Vox. Zapf described it as "a serifless roman," the stems taper (thick-thin contrast without serifs), and the terminals flare outward. Vox-ATypI places it under **Linéale Humaniste**; Frutiger's own system (see `./thibaudeau.md` for context) places it in **Incise**; DIN 16518 places it in **Antiqua-Varianten** (glyphic). All three are defensible.
- **Inter** (Rasmus Andersson, 2016), **Roboto** (Christian Robertson, 2011), **SF Pro** (Apple 2015) — modern UI sans with deliberately-mixed DNA. Inter is a Grotesque / Humanist hybrid; Roboto is Neo-Grotesque / Humanist / Geometric hybrid; SF Pro is its own lineage. Classification is educational only — foundries don't treat it as definitional.

### Incises (Glyphic)

Typefaces inspired by **chiseled-stone inscription**, specifically Roman capital inscriptions like the Trajan column (113 CE). Characteristics:

- **Flared stroke endings** instead of bracketed or slab serifs — the stroke widens at the terminal, as if chiseled with a chisel's taper.
- Often no true serifs — the flared terminal replaces the serif.
- Usually caps-only or caps-dominant (inscriptional faces are often uppercase-only).
- Tight letterspacing suitable for display-only use.

Anchor faces: Albertus (Berthold Wolpe, Monotype 1932 — a classic glyphic, text-usable), Copperplate Gothic (Frederic Goudy 1901 — flared, caps-only, was considered Linéale in some classifications because of its lack of proper serifs), Trajan (Carol Twombly, 1989 — caps-only, directly modeled on the Trajan column), Perpetua (Eric Gill, 1929 — a glyphic-influenced roman with more text usability), Friz Quadrata (Ernst Friz 1965), Meridien (Frutiger 1957).

Traps:

- **Copperplate Gothic** is sometimes classified as *Linéale* (because it has no true serifs) and sometimes *Incise* (because of its flared terminals). Modern foundries more often shelve it as Incise.
- **Optima** as noted above.
- **Perpetua** is a hybrid — glyphic terminals, but with serifs proper; sometimes classified as a Garalde with glyphic tendencies, sometimes as Incise.

### Scriptes (Script)

Typefaces imitating **formal handwriting with connected letters**. The letters connect via drawn strokes that extend from one glyph's end to the next glyph's start — requiring careful fit and often OpenType `calt`, `liga`, and `ccmp` lookups to produce clean joins.

Anchor faces: Zapfino (Hermann Zapf / David Siegel, Adobe 1998 — the canonical OpenType script, with up to eight alternates per lowercase letter), Bickham Script (Richard Lipton, Adobe 1997 — formal Copperplate engraving style), Snell Roundhand (Matthew Carter 1966 — after an 18th-c. English writing master), Shelley Script, Edwardian Script, Künstler Script, Kuenstler Script.

Characteristics:

- Slanted (9–15° typical).
- Connected ligation.
- Ornate, formal (as opposed to casual script — which falls in Manuaires).
- Often with multiple stylistic alternates.

### Manuaires (Graphic / Manuary)

The **casual-handwriting** category — hand-lettered letters that do not connect, and do not imitate a formal writing style. The boundary with Scriptes is that Manuaires do not connect; the boundary with Linéale is that Manuaires have an explicitly hand-made feel.

Anchor faces: Klang (Will Carter 1955), Papyrus (Chris Costello, 1982 — the infamous one), Lithos (Carol Twombly, Adobe 1989 — a Greek-stone-carving inspired display), Mistral (Roger Excoffon 1953 — connects but barely; borderline Scripte / Manuaire), Comic Sans (Vincent Connare, Microsoft 1994 — a casual Manuaire), Choc (Excoffon), Banco (Excoffon).

Traps:

- **Mistral** connects its letters but in a casual-cursive way, not a formal-calligraphic way — classified as Scripte or Manuaire depending on authority.
- **Comic Sans** is unambiguously Manuaire in Vox terms.

### Fractures (Black-letter)

The **broken-script tradition** — the original European movable-type typography (Gutenberg 1455 set in *Textura* blackletter). Vox keeps this as a bucket on its own, acknowledging that it stands outside the humanist-roman chronological arc.

Five historical sub-classes (these are DIN's five Gebrochene subdivisions; BS 2961 does not split blackletter):

- **Textura / Textur** — the most angular, tall, narrow blackletter — Gutenberg's Bible, Wycliffe-era manuscripts. Sharp pointed feet, tight lateral compression.
- **Rotunda** — a rounder, Italian-influenced blackletter, still used in Italy and Iberia longer than in Germany.
- **Schwabacher** — a 15th-c. German broken script with curved strokes, less angular than Textura; dominant in early German printing 1500–1530s.
- **Fraktur proper** — the defining German blackletter 1513 onward (the Dürer-Schönsperger collaboration with Johann Neudörffer for Emperor Maximilian I). Angular but with curvy flourishes; the dominant German script until 1941.
- **Kurrent** / Sütterlin — handwritten blackletter (distinct from printed fraktur), a German-language school-taught handwriting script through 1941.

Historical note: **Nazi Germany banned blackletter in January 1941** (the *Normalschrifterlass* / Antiqua Decree of Martin Bormann, which declared Fraktur "Schwabacher Judenlettern" — Jewish-Schwabacher letters — on spurious-Jewish-origin grounds, and replaced it with Antiqua as the official script). This is the reason German typography became roman-dominant postwar; pre-1941 German books set in Fraktur, post-1945 German books set in Antiqua.

Anchor faces: Textur (Berthold Textur, Monotype Old English), Fette Fraktur (Berthold 1875), Walbaum Fraktur, Fette Schwabacher, San Marco, Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch, Blackmoor, Cloister Black.

### Étrangères (Non-Latin) — 2010

Added in the 2010 revision as an acknowledgment that non-Latin scripts — Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Cyrillic, Devanagari, CJK, Thai, Hangul, Ethiopic, etc. — don't fit the Latin-rooted categories. This is not a serious classification of non-Latin typography; each script has its own history and conventions, documented script-by-script in `../scripts/`.

**Practical note**: real global foundries (Adobe, Google Noto, Indian Type Foundry, 29Letters, ArabicType, Latinotype for non-Latin-Latin, Typotheque) do *not* use "Étrangères" to describe non-Latin work. They use script-specific classifications: naskh / nastaliq / kufi for Arabic; unicameral categories for Hebrew; monotonic / polytonic for Greek; etc.

---

## Strengths

The Vox-ATypI system, despite its age and limits, remains in wide use for good reasons.

- **Vocabulary is broadly understood in European type education.** Any typographer trained in France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, or Scandinavia will recognize Garalde, Didone, Mécane, Linéale — using them needs no glossing.
- **Maps reasonably onto chronological history.** Teaching typographic history as Humanes → Garalde → Réale → Didone is a faithful simplification of what happened in European printing between 1460 and 1850.
- **Lineale subclassification captures meaningful sans-serif distinctions.** Grotesque vs Neo-Grotesque vs Geometric vs Humanist is the most durable output of BS 2961 and is now universal.
- **Categories reflect design sensibility, not just mechanics.** Unlike Thibaudeau's silhouette-based classification (see `./thibaudeau.md`), Vox's names refer to cultural / historical voice (Didone = the Didot-Bodoni Enlightenment sensibility), not just serif shape.

## Weaknesses and seams

Known limits, roughly in order of severity:

- **Non-Latin is entirely subsumed in one bucket.** Étrangères is not a classification; it's a punt. Anyone working in global typography needs per-script conventions; Vox is not adequate.
- **Digital-era innovation doesn't map.** Variable fonts, superfamilies (a single family with both serif and sans — Fedra, Skolar, Fraunces), icon fonts, emoji fonts, color fonts, COLRv1, and the screen-first UI-sans tradition (Inter, SF Pro, Roboto) don't fit any single category.
- **Some fonts genuinely don't fit any category.** Reverse-contrast faces (Karloff, Stencil, Big Moore — where the horizontals are heavier than the verticals, inverting the Didone contrast); grunge / distressed faces (Trixie, Remingtoned); experimental / deconstructivist display (Emigre faces from the 1990s); the "neo-transitional" contemporary tradition (Tiempos — Kris Sowersby, Klim 2010; Questa — Jos Buivenga and Martin Majoor 2014).
- **Boundary between Garalde and Réale is fuzzy.** Caslon is the canonical example; Baskerville is arguably transitional-Garalde; Times New Roman sits on the boundary. Practitioners handle this case-by-case.
- **Manuaires and Scriptes overlap.** Mistral and Excoffon's work is the running example; the connection criterion (connected → Scripte, unconnected → Manuaire) doesn't hold up for every face.
- **Contemporary neo-transitional faces sit between categories.** Tiempos is explicitly designed as "a contemporary neo-transitional" — it's Garalde in its proportions and Didone in its contrast. Questa is a literal merger of Didone and Sans within one family. Neither fits Vox cleanly.
- **Optical-size variants don't have category mobility.** A single face like Source Serif 4 has an `opsz` axis from 8pt to 60pt — at 8pt it reads more like Réale/Transitional, at 60pt more like Didone. Vox has no vocabulary for size-conditional classification.
- **Linéale subclasses don't cover screen-first sans.** Inter, Roboto, SF Pro, Segoe UI — arguably a new subclass ("UI Neo-Grotesque" or "Screen-first sans") — are shelved as Humanist or Neo-Grotesque based on the classifier's preference, with neither being fully accurate.

## Modern practice

Where Vox-ATypI actually lives in 2026:

- **European type education** — still taught as the reference classification in European type programs (École Estienne, Atelier National de Recherche Typographique, KABK, Reading, and others).
- **Foundry specimens** — historically-leaning foundries (Storm, Rosetta, TypeTogether, Commercial Classics, HTF) use Vox vocabulary. Contemporary foundries (Klim, GT, Pangram Pangram, Sharp, Dinamo) often don't — they use looser genre categories ("sans," "serif," "slab," "display," "mono," "script").
- **ATypI website** — continues to reference the Vox-ATypI classification (visible on atypi.org as of 2026-04-18).
- **Wikipedia and type-education material** — Vox-ATypI is the default classification used by any English-language type-history reference, with BS 2961's English names.
- **Digital-foundry marketing** — largely superseded by informal genre buckets. Adobe Fonts, Google Fonts, MyFonts, FontShop, Future Fonts, and Type Network all use a looser taxonomy (Serif, Sans Serif, Display, Slab, Script, Handwritten, Monospaced, Blackletter) that doesn't map cleanly to Vox. When Vox vocabulary appears, it's in category descriptions or subcategory filters ("Old Style" ≈ Garalde; "Transitional" ≈ Réale; "Modern" ≈ Didone; "Humanist Sans" ≈ Linéale Humaniste).
- **Academic type history and criticism** — still uses Vox as its reference vocabulary.
- **International type-design competitions** (Type Directors Club, ATypI's own Letter.2) — accept work in Vox categories alongside looser groupings.

Practical rule: **Vox-ATypI is useful vocabulary for precise type discussion** (when you need to communicate that Minion is Garalde and Baskerville is Transitional), but **ineffective as a contemporary taxonomy** when applied to the full modern corpus.

## Examples of classification disagreements

A list of faces where practitioners legitimately disagree — these are the cases to teach when demonstrating the seams of the system.

| Face | Vox (typical) | Alternative | Why it's contested |
|------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Optima** (Zapf 1958) | Linéale Humaniste | Incise (Frutiger's system, DIN's Antiqua-Varianten) | Flared chisel-terminals + humanist proportions — both defensible |
| **Caslon** (1720s) | Garalde | Réale / Transitional | Dated to the Transitional era but designed in the Garalde tradition |
| **Copperplate Gothic** (1901) | Incise | Linéale (no true serifs) | No true serifs but flared terminals — structurally glyphic, visually sans |
| **Futura** (1927) | Linéale Géométrique | — (canonical) | Well-established; the Geometric anchor |
| **Perpetua** (1929) | Incise | Garalde with glyphic tendencies | Has serifs but with chiseled-inscription design influence |
| **Times New Roman** (1932) | Réale | Garalde, or "newspaper transitional" | Designed as a transitional-derivative; sits on the boundary |
| **Avenir** (1988) | Linéale Géométrique | Linéale Humaniste Géométrique | "Humanist geometric" per Frutiger himself |
| **Fraunces** (Undercase Type, 2020) | — (resists clean classification) | Variable Garalde / Didone superfamily | An opsz+wght+SOFT+WONK variable that spans multiple traditions |
| **Comic Sans** (1994) | Manuaire | — | Uncontroversially Manuaire |
| **Trade Gothic** (1948) | Linéale Grotesque | — | Canonical American grotesque |
| **Recursive** (Stephen Nixon, 2021) | — (resists) | Linéale Sans/Mono with `CASL` (casual) + `slnt` axes | Variable font spanning sans, mono, casual, oblique |
| **Tiempos** (Klim, 2010) | Réale / Didone hybrid | "Neo-transitional" | Explicitly designed between Garalde and Didone |
| **Inter** (Andersson, 2016) | Linéale Grotesque / Humaniste | "UI sans" (new category) | Modern UI-first sans with deliberate hybrid DNA |
| **Mistral** (Excoffon, 1953) | Scripte or Manuaire | — | Connects but casually — boundary case |
| **Avant Garde Gothic** (Lubalin/Carnase, 1970) | Linéale Géométrique | — | Uncontroversially geometric |

These cases are pedagogically useful precisely because they demonstrate where the system's seams are.
